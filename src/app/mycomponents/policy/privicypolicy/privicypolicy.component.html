        <p>By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us. Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of sending you information and updates pertaining to your order.

        <h3>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
        <p>We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide ARSWA to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.</p>
        <h3>How Do We Protect Your Information?</h3>
        <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to ARSWA or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by ARSWA. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness by us. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.

        <h3>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
        <p>We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>
        <h3>What is GDPR?</h3>
        <p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
        <p>The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU residents. Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>
        <h3>What is personal data?</h3>
        <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
        <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
            <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
            <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
            <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Consumer Protection Act</h3>
        <p>The Consumer Protection Act is a legal framework designed to safeguard the rights and interests of consumers in various transactions. It aims to ensure fair business practices, protect consumers from deceptive advertising and unfair trade practices, and provide avenues for redressal in case of disputes or grievances with products or services. It typically covers areas like product safety, warranties, consumer rights, and the establishment of consumer courts or agencies to handle complaints. Keep in mind that specific details and provisions may vary depending on the country or region. </p>
        <p>You may exercise the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right to Know and Access. You may submit a verifiable request for information regarding the: (1) categories of Personal Information we collect, use, or share; (2) purposes for which categories of Personal Information are collected or used by us; (3) categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information; and (4) specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected about you.</li>
            <li>Right to Equal Service. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</li>
            <li>Right to Delete. You may submit a verifiable request to close your account and we will delete Personal Information about you that we have collected.</li>
            <li>Request that a business that sells a consumer's personal data, not sell the consumer's personal data.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you make a request, we have one month to respond to you. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.</p>
